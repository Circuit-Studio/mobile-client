# Circuit Studio for the iPad

A git-like tool to share circuit designs and schematics between users allowing each user who views your circuit design to make a copy to their library or make changes as a request to the original design, similarly to [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/).

## Some Achievements

- Use Moya to communicate to our [api](https://github.com/Circuit-Studio/api)

## Future Planned Developments

Client Frontend
- complete the cursor, textbox, and shape tools
- implement a save file for a circuit design

Client Backend
- use factories to create the components onto the canvas
